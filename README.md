We would have to create a 3 tier java application infrastructure on aws with the help of terraform using jenkins pipeline.

Features of architecture
- Highly available (available in both AZs)
- Highly scalable (Java applications should scale on cpu)
- Highly Secure 
- zero downtime deployment


In this architecture I used the following tools:-
1.IAAC-Terraform
2.CICD-Jenkins
3.AWS


The approach which i used to make application is mention below. There are few artefacts         
1.Arch diagram
2.Terraform code
3.Push it on Github
4.CICD Jenkins pipeline
5.Maven
6.Tomcat Deploy
